**Image Classification Project**


This project trains a model to recognize and classify multiple images using Teachable Machine and TensorFlow. 
It is designed to be beginner-friendly while providing powerful tools for machine learning. 


# Why This Project is Useful
Easy to Use: Perfect for learners with tools like Teachable Machine.

Practical Learning: Teaches image classification with real-world applications.

Flexible: Works with different input types (images, audio, text).

Powerful Backend: Uses TensorFlow for model training and deployment.


# How to Get Started
Follow these simple steps to begin:

1-Open Teachable Machine:

  Go to Teachable Machine.

  Choose "Image Project" (or audio/text if needed).

2-Train Your Model:

  Upload your dataset (images for classification).

  Adjust training settings and run the model.

3-Export the Model:

  Click "Export Model" and select TensorFlow (Keras format).

  Download the model files (.h5  + labels.txt).

4-Run in Google Colab:

  Open the provided Colab Notebook.

  Upload your model files.

  Insert the image path in the code and test predictions.

  `image = Image.open("image path").convert("RGB")`
